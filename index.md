Starting Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) can be both exciting and overwhelming. The endless sea of techniques and strategies can make it hard to know where to begin. Yet, mastering the basics and building a solid foundation is the key to long-term success. If you're new to BJJ, here’s your detailed guide on where to focus your efforts, how to be a great student, and which positions and techniques to prioritize in your early journey.

## Be a Good Student: The Foundation of Success

In BJJ, being a good student is the cornerstone of progress. The art is vast, and learning the right habits early on will set you up for long-term success. As a beginner, it’s advised to focus on the following key habits:

1. **Ask Questions**: Don’t hesitate to approach your coach or training partners with questions. Whether it’s about techniques, strategy, or situational specifics, asking questions helps you absorb concepts better and shows your commitment to learning.
2. **Take Notes**: After each class, spend time writing down what you learned. These notes don’t need to be overly detailed but should include the key movements, positions, and any important corrections or advice given by your instructor.
3. **Strive for Balance**: Aim to develop competence in all major positions (guard, top, side control, and back) to be a well-rounded grappler.
4. **Keep a Beginner’s Mindset**: Even as you advance, always remain open to learning and refining your game.

## Focus on Foundational Positions

As a beginner, it’s important to focus on mastering core positions. These foundational positions will serve as your building blocks as you progress through your BJJ journey. The most crucial positions to concentrate on are the **closed guard**, **half guard**, and **side control**.

### Closed Guard

The closed guard allows you to control your opponent’s posture while defending against their attacks. It’s a highly versatile position that offers opportunities to launch offensive attacks.

**Key Techniques:**

- **Kimura from Closed Guard**
- **Cross-Collar Choke**
- **Scissor Sweep**

### Half Guard

Half guard is a transitional position where you control one of your opponent’s legs with your legs while keeping them from passing into a more dominant position.

**Key Techniques:**

- **Half Guard Sweep (Old School Sweep)**
- **Deep Half Guard Entry**

### Side Control

Side control is a dominant top position where you control your opponent by pinning them to the mat while staying perpendicular to them.

**Key Techniques:**

- **Americana (Key Lock)**
- **Knee-on-Belly Transition**

## Basic Submissions Every Beginner Should Know

Mastering a few core submissions will help you feel confident. Here are the fundamental submissions to focus on during your early training:

- **Kimura**
- **Ezekiel Choke**
- **Scissor Sweep**
- **Armbar**
- **Triangle Choke**

## Practical Advice for Beginners

- **Drill Consistently**: Repetition is key. Aim to repeat key techniques slowly at first, ensuring correct movement before speeding up.
- **Breathe Properly**: Controlled breathing helps manage stress and keeps you focused.
- **Tap Early, Tap Often**: Tapping protects you from injury and keeps your training productive.

In conclusion, starting BJJ is about mastering the basics. Focus on key positions like closed guard, half guard, and side control, and learn effective submissions like the Kimura and Ezekiel choke. By building a solid foundation, you’ll progress faster and more efficiently in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
